# C#: Classes and objects
This project is all about learning how classes and objects work in C#.
In order to learn this, I will be making a tiny console bank program.
The end goal of this console bank program is to create a Client and his/her bank account, where they can make different deposits and withdrawals.

## Ready, Set, GET!
I have always been used to manually writing the setters and getters of every class.
But today, I learned it is possible to generate it automatically.
You do this by right-clicking in the editor where you'd like to add the setters and getters, click generate, and then choose the right ones.

## Classy move Mr. Sharp
Here's another very important thing I've learned: The Program.cs file should only contain methods that are being called.
One of my fellow Becode Learners taught me this.
This really helped me write cleaner, more readable, and more understandable code.

## Git off me' darn' property!
Properties.
The naming convention of properties in C# is something I'm still not too familiar with.
But now I learned that the properties themselves need to have an underscore in front of them.
